**Branch Name:** `react-training-projects`

**Description:**
This branch is dedicated to storing the projects and applications I created during my training on **React.js**. It includes a collection of small applications aimed at enhancing my understanding of React.js concepts, including state management, user routing, and interacting with APIs. Each project contains the code, documentation, and any notes related to development.
